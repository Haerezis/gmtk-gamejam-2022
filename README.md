## rough guide

### Create branch    

Creating a branch is good practice, so your work doesn't directly modify main.

1. click on main
2. type in name of branch
3. click 'create branch:X'

### clone

You can now clone this branch by pressing the green button on the left "Code"    
If you are using github desktop (recommended) choose "open with github desktop".

Github desktop should open and give you the option to choose your local path, I recommend making a folder with the patch name.
press clone, github will download the project on to the path you chose.

### import in godot

Now you can open up godot, and import the project.

### commit changes

Commiting changes won't send them to github yet, but it allows you to group changes and add a description.


You can see all the files that have changed on the left side panel. Select the files you want to commit, write a short description of the changes made and press commit.

### push commits

You can push multiple commits at once to github. You might have to 'fetch origin', which is a fancy word for updating. you can only push after fetching origin.

### pull request & merge
This is the last step, where other member can see your changes and comment on them. And lastly you can merge it to main.

Go to your branch on github, you can press on "contribute", and on the popup that appears "Open pull request".
